# -- Sudoku Solver --
A poor attempt at solving sudoku using brute force methods.

Currently, the project is able to solve sudoku puzzles that are of moderate difficulty or lower.
The inputs to the solver are hard coded into the program.

#Features:
1. Solves the puzzle through an iterative process
2. Makes guesses to continue solving the puzzle

#Setup:

Clone the git repository using <code>git clone https://github.com/glee-/sudoku_solver.git</code>
After cloning the repository, run the program within a terminal using <code>python solver.py</code>

Within the program, the solver is called through the function <b>solve(board)</b>
